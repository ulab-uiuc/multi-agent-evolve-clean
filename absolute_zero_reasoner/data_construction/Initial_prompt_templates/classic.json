Your job is to generate a complete, high-quality response that satisfies the task’s constraints and demonstrates clear, structured reasoning or creativity.\n\n### Instructions:\n- Carefully read and understand the task.\n- Think step by step — break down the task, simulate it mentally if needed, and reason through constraints.\n- Then directly write your final response (no need to restate or reformat the task).\n- Do **not** separate your answer into sections like \"task\", \"think\", or \"response\". Just give your best final answer with your reasoning embedded naturally or implied by structure.\n- Your output should:\n  * Be **correct** or **plausibly optimal**, given the task\n  * **Fulfill all constraints** in the task\n  * Be **clear, structured**, and **non-trivial**\n  * Avoid fluff, vagueness, or randomness\n\n### Good Response Traits:\n- For reasoning tasks: shows logical progression or result\n- For generation tasks: respects the given constraints (style, length, content)\n- For math/logic/planning: includes a final answer that could be evaluated\n- For creative tasks: coherent, original, and well-scaffolded\n",

      "base_template": "## Task: Create a Challenging and Original Task\n\nDesign a new and intellectually demanding task that tests **complex reasoning, creative thinking, structured planning, or deep understanding**. The task should be suitable for evaluation in general intelligence, reasoning benchmarks, instruction following, or alignment assessments.\n\nYou may design a task that resembles a quiz, puzzle, constrained writing, or symbolic reasoning prompt. Focus on structure, challenge, and clarity — not trivia or stylistic flair.\n\nThis prompt is intended to help construct the **task itself**, not example answers or input/output.\n\n---\n\n### Task Requirements:\n\n- The task must be:\n  * **Self-contained** and clearly described\n  * **Non-trivial**, requiring multiple reasoning steps, constraints, or synthesis\n  * **Deterministic** or tightly constrained (even if open-ended in form)\n  * **Free from cultural bias, real-time information, or factual recall**\n\n- Accepted Domains include:\n  * Logic puzzles, paradoxes, analogical reasoning\n  * Pattern-based math or symbolic challenges\n  * Spatial planning or constraint problems\n  * Structured or constrained writing\n  * Agent-based planning, recursive state modeling\n  * Instruction following with internal traps\n\n- Avoid:\n  * Trivia questions or subjective writing\n  * Ambiguous or taste-based open-ended prompts\n  * Any dependency on web access or recent knowledge\n  * Tasks with no clear solvability path\n\n---\n\n\nIMPORTANT: After generating each question, you must immediately provide a complete answer to verify it's solvable.\n\nFollow this iterative format:\n<question>\n[Your generated question here]\n</question>\n\n<answer>\n[Your complete solution to the question - show all steps and reasoning]\n</answer>\n\nAfter providing the answer, think: Is this question clear, solvable, and appropriately challenging? If not, generate a new question-answer pair using the same format.\n\nContinue this process until you have a well-formed, solvable question. The final output should contain your best question-answer pair.\n\nMAKE SURE THAT YOUR FINAL QUESTION IS INSIDE A <question></question> TAG! THE LAST QUESTION OF THIS PATTERN WILL BE EXTRACTED AS YOUR FINAL QUESTION!\n\nMake sure your final question is:\n- Clear and unambiguous\n- Solvable with the information provided\n- Appropriately challenging for the domain\n- Complete (not missing any necessary information)\n\nYour answer should demonstrate that the question is indeed solvable by providing a complete solution.",
